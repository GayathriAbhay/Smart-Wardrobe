Smart Wardrobe - Digital Closet Manager
Smart Wardrobe is a lightweight, frontend-driven web application designed to help users digitize their physical wardrobe. It features a modern, responsive interface for uploading clothing images, adding metadata (color, category, season), and viewing an organized collection.

-- Architecture Overview
The application follows a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture, where different "screens" are toggled within a single HTML file to provide a seamless user experience without page reloads.

1. Frontend Layer (UI/UX)
HTML5: Defines the structure of the three main screens: Home, Upload, and Wardrobe.

CSS3: Provides a custom "Soft Aesthetic" design system using CSS variables for consistent pink, cream, and beige tones. It includes a responsive grid system and mobile-first media queries.

Vanilla JavaScript: Manages the application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and screen navigation.

2. Data Persistence
Local Storage: The application uses the browser's localStorage to save wardrobe items as JSON objects. This ensures that the user's closet data persists even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

3. State Management
Global Variables: A temporary state (window.currentFile) is used to hold image data during the upload and preview process before it is committed to permanent storage.

-- Code Breakdown
Navigation Logic (app.js & index.html)
The SPA functionality is controlled by the showScreen(screenId) function.

Active States: JavaScript toggles the .active class on section elements. In CSS, .screen is set to display: none by default, while .screen.active uses display: block.

Functionality: Specific functions like MapsToHome(), MapsToUpload(), and MapsToWardrobe() manage UI updates and trigger data loading (e.g., loadWardrobe()).

Image Processing (app.js)
File Handling: The app supports both "Click to Upload" and "Drag & Drop" via the FileReader API.

Data Conversion: Images are converted into Base64 Data URLs via reader.readAsDataURL(file). This allows the image string to be stored directly in localStorage alongside the item metadata.

Wardrobe Management (app.js)
Form Submission: The metadataForm listener captures user input (Category, Color, Season, Style Tags) and creates a wardrobeItem object with a unique ID generated by Date.now().

Dynamic Rendering: loadWardrobe() clears the existing grid and reconstructs it by iterating through the stored array. If no items exist, an empty-state template is shown.

-- Design System
The application uses a specific color palette defined in the CSS :root:

Primary Pink: #FFB6D9 (Buttons, borders, and accents).

Backgrounds: A mix of pale-pink and cream for a soft, clean look.

Responsiveness: The wardrobe-grid uses grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr)), allowing the layout to automatically adjust based on screen size (Desktop vs. Tablet vs. Mobile).

-- Key Features
Drag & Drop Upload: Intuitive interface for adding new clothes.

Image Preview: Users can see their item before finalizing the upload.

Metadata Tagging: Categorize items by type (Top, Bottom, etc.), color, and season for better organization.

Digital Gallery: A visual grid of all uploaded items with decorative badges for easy identification.

No Backend Required: Runs entirely in the client's browser, ensuring privacy and speed.

-- File Structure
index.html: The core structure containing all three screens.

style.css: The styling engine and responsive design rules.

app.js: The "brain" of the app, handling data, navigation, and events.
